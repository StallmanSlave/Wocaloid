# Wocaloid
Open source version of Vocaloid/Utau (unoffical)

The project is aimed to be a voice synthesizer for both music and natural language (utau, with the priority of the project being ported to linux (possibly freeBSD) and written primarly in c++.

Will update once I get base code done on git

Note- This is my first big project of mine, so tolorate my bad programming habits and give me feedback.
